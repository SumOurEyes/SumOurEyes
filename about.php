		<p>SumOurEyes is summarizing in an intelligent and collaborative way. Let us briefly explain how it works.</p>
		<p>Go to you projects and add a new project. Within a project, add as many chapters as you want. Click on a chapter to open it.</p>
		<p>Within a chapter, you can add notes. Type something in the textbox and click on add to add the note. Notes can be edited by just clicking on its text.</p>
			<p>Now here comes the cool stuff: when you put [brackets] around a word,
			it becomes a keyword for that note. Next time you mention that word in your project, it will be linked to the original note. Cool!</p>
		<p>Want to share a project with your friends? Just go to your projects page, put your mouse on the project you want to share and click 'share'!</p>
